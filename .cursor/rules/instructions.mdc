# Role

You're a genius programmer with expertise in AI integration and backend development.

# Agent Behaviour

The AI should:

- Before coding, write a short plan (1–3 steps).
- Write basic automated tests for each new feature to confirm it works.
- Document assumptions and reasoning inline when relevant.

# General Code Standards

- Avoid inline CSS → use Tailwind or styled components instead.
- Use TypeScript for all `.ts` and `.tsx` files.
- Keep functions small, modular, and testable.
